# Professional Self-Assessment
My name is Jessica Millet. This is my professional self-assessment for the CS 499 Capstone ePortfolio. This ePortfolio symbolizes the skills that I have gained in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. 
It showcases how I have developed and implemented my skills in Software Engineering and Design, Algorithms and Data Structures, Databases, following the best security practices. 

## Program Reflection and Skills Gained
Throughout the work that I have done in several courses, I have learned and followed core computer science principles such as object-oriented programming, full-stack development, secure coding practices, and program design. 
I was able to implement these skills in the CS 499 Capstone project into the Travlr Getaways web application artifact.

After implementing my enhancements to the Travlr Getaways web application original artifact, it shows my abilities to:
* Plan, design, and ensure code scalability and code maintainability
* Document enhancements in a professional and clear manner
* Improve program performance and data access optimization
* Apply protected role-based user access

Skills like this help to ensure career ability as a full-stack developer.

## Communication and Collaboration
I learned how to voice and document my plans in a clear and understandable way as I was reviewing code and making my enhancements to the code. 
Being able to create the code review video helps me to practice communicating in a professional verbal way with visuals of technical concepts to stakeholders.
I ensured that my enhancements align with best coding practices, such as adding inline comments, consistency in naming elements. These practices help with collaborating in a team setting, with the right tools to help with decision-making.

## Course Outcome
These are the skills that I have demonstrated through my enhancements in the Travlr Getaways application, which align with the Computer Science Program:

* **Software Engineering and Design:** Added inline comments, split up large functions, and improved maintainability and code readability.
* **Algorithms and Data Structures:** Used `Set` objects for quicker trip lookups for optimization and reduced code repetition.
* **Databases:** Added a `location` field, implemented role-based access controls, and integrated protected API route handling.
* **Security:** Used middleware for JWT token validation, enforced role-based access controls to protected routes, integrity of the data, and data access is secured.
* **Collaboration:** Wrote clean, readable code and ensured communication of the enhancements was clear, understandable, and effective in the documentation that I wrote, and in my code review recorded a video as well.

## Conclusion
After finalizing the enhancements to the Travlr Getaways Web Application artifact in the CS 499 Capstone and completing this ePortfolio, it has helped make my skills stronger and showcase my ability and readiness for the Computer Science field. 
I can confidently say that I am able to design and develop web applications that are effective using emerging technologies. My enhancements demonstrate my skills in using code usability, maintaining code, and code security, which are core skills for web developers.  
Each of the three of my enhancements was made using the Travlr Getaways Web Application, which showcases how I am able to make improvements to a single artifact across multiple categories in Computer Science.
