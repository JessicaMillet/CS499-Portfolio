**Note**: This video shows the original artifact and explains the areas in my code that I will make my enhancements to based on Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. 

## Artifact Details

**Project Name:** Travlr Getaways 

**Technologies:** MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js

**Purpose:** Shows my code review skills

**Original Artifact:** Travlr Getaways Web App that I developed from CS 465 Full Stack Development course

## Planned Enhancements Summary 

* Adding inline comments for better understanding and clarity

* Split up large functions to be easier to maintain

* Use a Set object for quicker trip lookups

* Add a location field and role-based access controls to improve filtering and security


**UPDATE:** I have made modifications to additional frontend components (such as `trip-card.component.html`) to demonstrate my skills in database enhancements by implementing the `location` field and enforcing role-based access controls for admin and regular users.
